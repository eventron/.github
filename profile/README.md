## How to Get Started 🚀

1. **Explore Your City's Repository:** Start by browsing your city's repository. If it doesn't exist yet, consider creating one. The repository's name should be in the format `cityname-countryname` (e.g., `toronto-canada`).

2. **Share Your Event:** If you have an event you'd like to host or promote, create a new issue in your city's repository. Provide all the necessary details, such as event date, time, location, and a brief description. Engage with the community by responding to comments and questions. 💬

3. **Contribute to Open Source:** If you're interested in contributing to open source, explore our codebases, and pick an issue to work on. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Our community is here to help you get started with open source development. 🛠️
