  <h1>Welcome to Eventron - Share Your Events! 🎉</h1>
</div>


Eventron is a community-driven open source project dedicated to helping you to list your events in your city and beyond. GitHub is the perfect platform to connect with like-minded individuals and showcase your event-planning skills to the world. 🌍

## What You'll Find Here 📚

- **City-Specific Repositories:** Eventron provides a repository for each city, allowing you to share and discover local events. Find your city's repository and start sharing your upcoming events or browsing events hosted by others in your area. 🏙️

- **Open Source Experience:** Eventron is not just about events; it's also an opportunity to learn and contribute to open source. If you're new to open source, we encourage you to explore the codebases, experiment, and make your first pull request. Join the open source community and grow your skills while collaborating with others. 💻

## How to Get Started 🚀

1. **Explore Your City's Repository:** Start by browsing your city's repository. If it doesn't exist yet, consider creating one. The repository's name should be in the format `cityname-countryname` (e.g., `toronto-canada`).

2. **Share Your Event:** If you have an event you'd like to host or promote, create a new issue in your city's repository. Provide all the necessary details, such as event date, time, location, and a brief description. Engage with the community by responding to comments and questions. 💬

3. **Contribute to Open Source:** If you're interested in contributing to open source, explore our codebases, and pick an issue to work on. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Our community is here to help you get started with open source development. 🛠️
